All our finalized notebooks are in the "Finalized" folder. Please run the jupyter notebook in the order of step numbers in title. Please note that since we reorgnized the repository, files' relative paths have change. If you encounter any error, please change the file path accordingly. 

1. Run Step1_WIDS+EDA.ipynb
This is our EDA process.
2. Run Step2_WIDS_Feature_Engineer_0309.ipynb
We created additional features. 
3. Run Step3_lightgbm_baselinemodels.ipynb
We built a basedline model by only using the raw and unimputed dataset.
4. Step4_Model_Iterations.ipynb
We ran three models plus resampling methods on our imputed dataset.
